            <h2>What is Image Compression Algorithm</h2>
            <p>Image Compression Algorithm is basically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A set of rules and procedures for reducing the file size of an image while retaining its image to the naked eye (does not lose essential visual information)</li>
                <li>Accomplishes this compression by removing redundant (or useless data) from the image.</li>
                <li>Is important because it allows for efficient storage and transmission of these compressed images.</li>
                <li>In other words, the algorithm saves disk space and reduces bandwidth requirements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>History behind Technology</h2>
            <p>The first image compression models date back several decades.</p>
            <p>Early image compression techniques focused on basic methods, such as the Run-Length Encoding or the Huffman coding.</p>
            <p>Over time, more advanced algorithms were developed. Today, we will be looking at some of these advanced algorithms</p>
            <p>Some popular ones are Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) used in JPEG compression and Wavelet Transform used in JPEG2000. Here is Huffman who created the Huffman coding.<br /><br /><img src="https://maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/46/Pengelley_projects/Project-14/Fano-MIT-1975.jpg" alt="Discovery of Huffman Codes | Mathematical Association of America" /></p>

            <h2>Significance</h2>
            <p>This is independent content</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Image compression is significant because it enables efficient storage and transmission of images.</li>
                <li>It reduces the file size of images, making it easier to store large collections of images on devices or servers.</li>
                <li>Compressed images can be transmitted more quickly over networks, allowing for faster image sharing and website loading times.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Imagine you have a bunch of pictures on your phone, and you want to share all of them with your friends. First, you want to store it without taking up too much space. That's where image compression comes in! </p>
            <p>Every pictures is different. Some photos are taken on an iPhone with an HEIC encoding. Others are downloaded from the internet so you have an jpg or GIF. Thus, different ways of compression are needed for each picture type. Some pictures have more colors and intricacies, while others may have a simpler design.</p>
            <p>So, having many compression algorithms enables us to choose best option. The optimal option is the best balance between maintaining its quality and minimizing the file size. It's similar to having several tools in a toolbox. Having many tools allow you to use the appropriate tool for each task. With the many compression algorithms available, we may accomplish varying degrees of compression and image quality to fit the distinct qualities of each photo.</p>
